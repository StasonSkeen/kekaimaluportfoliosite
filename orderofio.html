                          To understand the direction my design process would need to go I began research and understanding 
                          the religion's history, culture, and what kind of cult this would be. I discovered what kind of design, copywriting, 
                          textures, copywriting, etc that would best convey visually the purpose and message of the Order of ‘Io.

                        <p>
                          The first thing I began designing was the religious symbol that would represent the Order of ‘Io, this symbol 
                          would be the Cross, Star of David, or Wheel of Dharma to the Order of ‘Io. From my research 
                          Anthropologist Dr. Daniel Kikawa cites Calvin Kawailani Eaton's collections of Hawaiian oral traditions 
                          that describes the puloʻuloʻu as a representation of the Supreme Being ‘Io. The puloʻuloʻu, a white kapa cloth ball wrapped atop a stick, was the symbol I used to represent ‘Io. Māori historian, Te Rangi Hiroa, also discovered that in Aotearoa an account of the cosmogony of the world described ‘Io as having come from 
                          "Te Kore" or the void, so I designed two logos a "positive" symbol (left) with ‘Io in a created world and a "negative" symbol (right) with ‘Io in Te Kore.

                        <p>
                          Next I began designing posters that would be used to inform beleivers of the many descriptor names of ‘Io as 
                          cited by Te Rangi Hiroa. I wanted the design of the posters to feel "rough" like it were made in ancient times but 
                          to also be modern in some ways. To properly get this aesthetic I found Hala seeds from the floor that fell from a Hala tree 
                          and used this as a paint brush to design the representations of the names of ‘Io, these seed brushes provided the "roughness" 
                          I was looking for and scanning my paintings into a computer and designing allowed for the "moderness" to come through as well.

                            Continuing design my designs aimed at beleivers of the faith of ‘Io, I created a T-shirt design that relates to the Order of ‘Io 
                            belief in the Huinakolu Lōkahi (Triangle of Harmony). The design features a Hawaiian hawk a representation of the Being ‘Io, a kapa pattern 
                            of the weaving of ti leaves, this kapa pattern represents a piko specifically the umblical chord showing the connection ‘Io has with all things 
                            created by ‘Io. The Hawaiian hawk is soaring in front of the Huinakolu Lōkahi members of the Order of ‘Io beleive that if these three things are kept in 
                            harmony life will be good ‘āina, kānaka, and ‘Io.

                            In the 1931 issue of the "Paradise of the Pacific" magazine, native Hawaiian historian Emma Anuhea Taylor described the history 
                            and teachings of the ‘Io beleivers in her article "The Cult of ‘Iolani." She described the clothing of ‘Io priests being the color 
                            yellow so to reflect the beliefs of the ancient faith I chose the colour yellow for the Aloha shirt. Another topic covered in Taylor's 
                            article was another name by which ‘Io went by which was Kue-manu-‘ai-lehua or the beak that feeds on "lehuas" or the power of death. To reflect 
                            this name I once again used the piko to represent ‘Io's power over life and the lehua as ‘Io's power over death.
