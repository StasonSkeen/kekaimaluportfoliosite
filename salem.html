                        <h2>research&nbsp;& understanding</h2>
                        <p>Before designing the new logo for Salem, MA, I began by researching the history, culture, architecture, art, etc. 
                          to gain an understanding of what the logo should look like in order to visually represent the city as best as I could.
                          From my research I gathered that the Witch Trials of the late 1600s to 1700s had a large impact on the culture of Salem,
                          the Salem Witch Trials are a huge part of the city's aesthetic and economy. However, the history of Salem isn't only tied
                          to the Witch Trials. During the Revolutionary War, Salem's naval base and docks were vital in swaying the war to the U.S.'s 
                          favor and in 2013 President Barack Obama signed in to writing that Salem, MA was the birthplace of the American National Gaurd.
                          These key concepts would be what I would use to help represent Salem visually through the logo redesign.

                        <h2>sketching</h2>
                        <p>After getting enough information that I can now say that I understand the City of Salem, I begin the process of brainstorming
                          by sketching out my ideas onto paper. The sketching phase is a kinda of splatter of ideas, there are no bad ideas just never enough ideas.
                          I end up with a little over 200 sketch ideas for the potential logo enough to begin seeing which are the best candidates for visually representing
                          Salem. I find that the three that best do this are a witch's hat that also doubles as a sail boat, a witch's black mirror, and a nautical star paired
                          with a witch's spell book are the three best designs.

                        <h2>digitizing & choosing</h2>
                        <p>I chose these three designs from my sketching process and made them digital in order to see which one I would take to the next phase
                          which would be refining the chosen one and finalizing the new redesigned Salem city logo. The debate fell sharply on the Witch's Black mirror
                          and the paired Nautical Star with the spellbook. Although the Witch's mirror did greatly capture the witch aesthetic prevalent around Salem
                          I came to the conclusion that Salem is not just the Witch Trials it also has more history that makes up the sum of what Salem, MA is, so I chose
                          the pairing of the Star and Book.

                        <p>After choosing the design I refined it further in order to make sure it was exact. For the version in colour I chose the book to be a 
                          dull purple in order to show the dark and dull past of Salem and the bright yellow to shine a brighter future. The spellbook and star have 
                          the same corresponding meanings, that although the past is dark the future doesn't have to be the same.
